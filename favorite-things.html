  <h1>My favorite things</h1>
  <body>
    <p class="intro">My top most favorite things are <em>my friends and food</em> I enjoy spending time with my friends most of the time when I am not working. I find this therapeutic and healing. Friends make me laugh and appreciate life. Food is always good for the soul! It nourishes our body and savours our pallet.</p>
    <p class="experience">What is this life without good company of friends and delicious food!Life without friends would be boring. Friendships help us to grow and provides an environment for self reflection and appreciation. Delicious food on the other hand creates an experience for us that we can always remember and relate to.</p>
    <p>Below is a list of my die hard friends that I have come to appreciate in my life</p>
    <ul>
